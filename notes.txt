The challenge should be to listen to changes on that dropdown,
When user selects new year, you should listen to that event and make sure that this picked year is in the end forwarded to the expenses component,
Add the expense filter in there and fw the picked year from the expense filter to the expenses component and store it in a state.

- listen to the change event
    - add event listener to component
- fw the data to a higher level component (expense component)
    - In the parent component, create a callback function. This callback function will retrieve the data from the child component.
    - Pass the callback function to the child as a props from the parent component.
    - The child component calls the parent callback function using props and passes the data to the parent component.
- store the component in a state
